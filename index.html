         <h2>Project Topic and Exploration Questions</h2>
         <p>For our project, we are examining COVID deaths in the US Midwest region (Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota) during 2020. With this data, we are looking at how different age and racial groups were affected disparately by the disease. Similarly, we will incorporate information regarding lockdowns and reopenings to understand how government reaction to COVID affected COVID deaths.</p>

         <p>Question 1: What age group had the highest death rate?</p>
         <p>Question 2: What age group had the lowest death rate?</p>
         <p>Question 3: What states were hit hardest/least hard by COVID?</p>
         <p>Question 4: What races in the US were hit hardest/least hard by COVID?</p>
         <p>Question 5: Is there a relationship between income and potential to die from COVID?</p>
         <p>Question 6: Were wealthier/less wealthy people affected by COVID differently than by other diseases?</p>
         <p>We should probably add more questions that are more targeted at OUR specific project and the way it has gone.</p>

         <p>Insert the CSVs and any website info we may use about government policies.</p>

         <h2>Data Journey and Caveats</h2>
         <p>At the beginning of this project, we intended to include data regarding the entire United States. However, when looking at how large the dataset was and how unmanageable this data was (Python could not process the initial, entire CSV), we decided to focus particularly on the Midwest. We chose the Midwest not only because the states have a diversity in political orientation, but also because it is applicable to us at Notre Dame in Indiana. After speaking with Professor Kumar about how to refine our data and focus our project, we decided to orient our analysis to the ramifications of political policy on COVID deaths.</p>
         <p>Because of the limited scope of our dataset, there are a few caveats that must be considered. Firstly, because we are only looking at the Midwest, this data may be correlated to the general trend of the US, but it cannot be taken as representative of the entire country. Similarly, there are a multitide of factors that we would have liked to focus more on (like income, access to healthcare, and geographical location within the state), but because of the size of the project, we could not incorporate this data. Thus, when considering the insights of the project, remember that there may be alternative factors that we have not fully taken into account.</p>

         <h6>Will Mansour</h6>
         <p>I am a sophomore history major from Dallas, TX. I focus my historical research and courseload on issues regarding slavery, race, and the economy in the 19th century US. In my free time, I like to watch and play sports, exercise, and watch movies with my friends. This project interests me because I am passionate about public policy and how to lessen the negative effects of disease.</p>
